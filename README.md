This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## useState

Update useState array by removing single or all items.

### 2. Simple Reviews Widget

Though we use only useState hook, a lot of styling involved where we get to learn how to add react-icons, how to use ::before pseudo class to style the image.

### 3. Accordion

This can be used for FAQs section where one question dropdown closes when the next question is clicked. Implemented SAAS for better organization of styling.

## useEffect

### 4. Tours

Similar to Birthday reminder app but we are using a simple API so that we can introduce side-effects that can be handled by useEffect hook.
Also, implemented simple Loading and Error display if the component doesn't re-render.

### 5. Slider

This has to do little with CSS transforms. A good overall practice app which allows us to think about not only react way but also some CSS way.

### 6. Menu

Restaurant menu displays different food items based on the selected categories. Demonstrated how we can set the CSS active class for selected category. Used CSS grid for the layout.

## Forms

### 7. Text Generator

Introducing forms in react. I've used simple input to demonstrate the basics of the form. I've also used useRef hook to highlight the input (focus) when app loads. You can generate as many paragraphs as you want and then copy with a button click. To make the copy possible, I've used a react library react-copy-to-clipboard.
