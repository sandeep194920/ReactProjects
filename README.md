### 2. Simple Reviews Widget

Though we use only useState hook, a lot of styling involved where we get to learn how to add react-icons, how to use ::before pseudo class to style the image.

### 3. Accordion

This can be used for FAQs section where one question dropdown closes when the next question is clicked. Implemented SAAS for better organization of styling.

## useEffect

### 4. Tours

Similar to Birthday reminder app but we are using a simple API so that we can introduce side-effects that can be handled by useEffect hook.
Also, implemented simple Loading and Error display if the component doesn't re-render.
